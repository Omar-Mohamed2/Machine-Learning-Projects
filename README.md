## Project Overview
Provide a brief description of your project:
- What problem does it solve?
- Why is this project useful?
- How does it work?

*Example:*
This project aims to predict housing prices using various machine learning algorithms. It provides an interface to input features like the number of rooms, location, and size to estimate the market price of a house. This tool can be useful for real estate agents and buyers to make informed decisions.

## Features
- Predict housing prices based on multiple input features
- Visualize data and model predictions
- Support for multiple machine learning algorithms
- Easy-to-use interface for predictions

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the required packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Explain how to use your project:
1. **Preprocess the data:**
    ```bash
    python preprocess.py
    ```
2. **Train the model:**
    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```
3. **Make predictions:**
    ```bash
    python predict.py --input data/input.json
    ```

*Note: Provide examples or screenshots if possible.*

## Dataset
Include information about the dataset used:
- Source of the dataset
- Link to download the dataset
- Brief description of the dataset

*Example:*
The dataset used in this project is the [California Housing Prices dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/camnugent/california-housing-prices). It includes features such as the median income, housing median age, and number of rooms to predict the median house value.

## Model Architecture
Describe the model architecture and algorithms used:
- Which algorithms were tried?
- Final model architecture
- Hyperparameters used

*Example:*
We used a Random Forest Regressor with the following hyperparameters:
- Number of estimators: 100
- Max depth: 10

## Results
Present the results of your model:
- Accuracy metrics
- Visualization of predictions vs actual values
- Any other relevant performance metrics

*Example:*
The final model achieved an RMSE of 0.5 on the test set. Below is a plot comparing the predicted prices to the actual prices.
